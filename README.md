# Video Game Sales Analysis

This Jupyter notebook analyzes video game sales data scraped from Metacritic.com, Vgchartz, and HowLongToBeat.com to find what factors most influence video game sales. The analysis and findings are detailed within the notebook which can be accessed using the link below. This was a self-paced final project with a topic of my choosing.

## Programming concepts used
- Data scraping with Pandas
- Data analysis with Numpy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib pyplot
- Statistical analysis using Sklearn linear regression models and seaborn for violin plots

## Possible Improvements
- Introducing additional variables into the models such as the initial cost of a video game on release. This might not show much of a relationship to sales given that most AAA video games sell at $60 USD. 
- Analyze the effect publisher has on sales. Can an indie game outsell a AAA published game with the same features and same release date? 
- Analyze the effect developer has on sales. Does developer reputation matter? Ex. Bethesda Games Studio faced a lot of backlash with Fallout 76, but does that affect sales of new releases like Starfield?
